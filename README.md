# Elm Reorderable List

A drag and drop reorderable list component for elm.

Still in progress, it works pretty nicely so far, though is undocumented and the
API might change a bit before it's released to elm-packages.

## Examples

  1. [Simple](https://rohanorton.github.io/elm-reorderable-list/Simple.html) /
     [Code](https://github.com/rohanorton/elm-reorderable-list/blob/master/examples/Simple.elm)
  2. [More complex](https://rohanorton.github.io/elm-reorderable-list/Todo.html) /
     [Code](https://github.com/rohanorton/elm-reorderable-list/blob/master/examples/Todo.elm)

## Roadmap

These are features that I am going to try and implement soon:

- Items that are sortable -- using selectors class / id ??
- Animation
- Snap to grid
- Restrict to container
- Axis
- Legacy browser compatibility
- Page scroll when nearing edge??
